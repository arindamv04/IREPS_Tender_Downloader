# Tender Documents Downloader: Chrome Extension Summary

## Purpose

The Tender Documents Downloader is a Chrome extension designed to streamline the process of downloading government tender documents. Government procurement portals typically contain multiple supporting documents (between 2 to 20 files per tender) that must be downloaded and organized for bid preparation. 

## Key Problem Solved

This extension addresses several critical challenges in the procurement process:

1. **Session Timeout Issues**: Government procurement portals often expire user sessions after brief periods of inactivity, typically permitting only one login per hour. This creates significant pressure to quickly collect all necessary documents.

2. **Document Organization**: Manually downloading and organizing 2-20 supporting documents for each tender is time-consuming and prone to error.

3. **Efficiency**: The traditional method of clicking each document individually, waiting for downloads, and creating folders causes delays and reduces the number of tenders that can be evaluated within the limited session time.

## How It Works

The extension provides a simple one-click solution that:

1. Scans the current tender page for all downloadable documents using intelligent detection of file links based on extensions, keywords, and HTML attributes.

2. Creates a timestamped folder with the tender name automatically, ensuring all documents are properly organized by tender.

3. Downloads all detected documents into this folder simultaneously, eliminating the need for manual clicking and organization.

4. Allows the user to quickly move to the next tender page, maximizing the number of tenders that can be processed within the limited login window.

## Benefits

- **Time Savings**: Reduces document collection time from minutes to seconds per tender
- **Organization**: Automatically sorts documents into properly named folders
- **Reduced Session Timeouts**: Minimizes the risk of session expiration during document collection
- **Higher Productivity**: Allows procurement professionals to evaluate more tenders within the limited login window
- **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates the possibility of missing important documents or files

The extension enables procurement professionals to focus on evaluating tender requirements rather than struggling with the mechanics of document collection and organization, ultimately leading to more informed bidding decisions and better procurement outcomes.
